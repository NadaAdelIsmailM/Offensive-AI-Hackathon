# Offensive AI Hackathon Project

This repository contains my solution for the [Offensive AI Hackathon by CyShield](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cyshield_cyshield-hackathon-cybersecurity-activity-7262641159510839296-Ux3g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEvatigBLtPUGwWp9susOug_5CZOYrnCrwk). The goal of the hackathon was to build an AI-powered tool capable of autonomously exploiting web application vulnerabilities, using minimal manual interaction.

## Overview

This project demonstrates automated vulnerability detection and exploitation using Python. It targets a vulnerable web application setup (such as DVWA) and leverages AI or systematic scanning techniques to identify and exploit weaknesses. The challenge required incorporating multiple steps—scanning, enumerating vulnerabilities, generating exploit strategies, and executing them seamlessly.

For more information about the hackathon and its objectives, check out the [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cyshield_cyshield-hackathon-cybersecurity-activity-7262641159510839296-Ux3g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEvatigBLtPUGwWp9susOug_5CZOYrnCrwk).

## Features

- Automated scanning for common web vulnerabilities.  
- Integration with Kali Linux command-line tools or APIs (if applicable).  
- AI-driven or script-based logic to reduce manual intervention.  
- Vulnerability exploitation in a controlled environment (e.g., DVWA).  

## Dependencies

Below is the list of dependencies; adjust according to your environment and code specifics:
 
- Python 3.8+
- Requests (for HTTP requests)
- BeautifulSoup (for HTML parsing)
- Other libraries depending on your approach, e.g., Selenium, sklearn, etc.

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Update configuration (targets, credentials, scanning parameters) in the script if necessary.
6. Run the main exploit script:
   ```
   python 3.py
   ```

## Project Structure

A possible project structure layout:

```
your-repo-name/
├── 3.py                  # Main Python script
├── requirements.txt      # Dependencies
├── README.md             # This file
└── ...
```

- **3.py**: Contains the core logic for scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities.  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the libraries needed.  
- **README.md**: You are reading it now.

## How It Works

1. **Scanning & Enumeration**: The script locates potential vulnerabilities by probing known endpoints and forms within DVWA (or your chosen vulnerable app).  
2. **Payload Generation**: Based on identified vulnerabilities, the script can craft payloads to exploit the web application.  
3. **Execution & Verification**: Each payload is tested, and the script analyzes the response to confirm whether the exploit succeeded.  
4. **Reporting**: It logs the process and any successful exploit steps, providing insights into what worked and what did not.

This approach showcases a streamlined pipeline that automatically tests known vulnerability types in a safe, controlled environment.
